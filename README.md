Introduction
============
Welcome, to MonitorMe. I wanted to be able to easily manage my server from an Android (or any device that supports UDP networking!) device. At first, it seemed like a dream, and it would be imposssible to make a successor to Minecraft MobileAdmin. A few weeks later, I started handcrafting that dream. Here I am now.

Information
===========
MontiorMe is an open-source Bukkit plugin for monitoring a Minecraft server via Android (can be expanded to other platforms). This is currently in pre-alpha and it not even close to being finished.

Help me!
========
However, on a much sadder note, I don't have time to develop this on my own. If anyone wants to help me out, please contact me. Or, just make a pull request, and if it's to my standards, I'll accept it.
