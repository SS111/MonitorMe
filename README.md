MonitorMe
=========
A Bukkit plugin for monitoring a Minecraft server via an Android device!
This is currently in pre-alpha and it not even close to being functional.
The commits with the version prefix TEST_# are for me testing and aren't functional. However, if you want to look at how I'm coming along, feel free.
And above all, enjoy!
